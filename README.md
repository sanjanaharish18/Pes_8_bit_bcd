## 1. Introduction <br />
The 8 bit Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) Counter is a counter that counts 100 digits starting from 0 to 99.BCD is an encoding where each digit in a decimal number is represented in the form of bits(usually 4 bits). For example the number 89 can be represented as 10001001 in BCD as 1000 is the BCD representation of 8 and 1001 is the BCD representation of 9.BCD code is also known as 8421 BCD code. This also makes it a weighted code which implies that each bit in the four bit groups representing each decimal digit has a specific weight. As compared to prevalent binary positioning system itâ€™s easy to convert it into human readable representation with the drawback of slight increase in complexity of the circuits.<br />
<br />
## 2. Application of BCD Counter<br />
The BCD Counter finds application in clock production, clock division, used in minimal power cmos circuit, implemented in frequency counting circuits.<br />
<br />
## 3. Verilog Implementation of BCD Counter <br />
The 8 bit BCD counter counts from 00000000(0) to 10011001(99). After that it resets to initial value 0 and the process is repeated again. The Verilog code contains 8 bit output and clock, reset & enable as input. The 8 bit BCD counter block diagram is shown in Fig1 and the port list are given in Table1.In Fig2 output waveform for few clock cycles is displayed.<br />
<br />
The block diagram of BCD counter is shown below.

## 4. Functional simulation <br />

### 4.1 Softwares  <br />
### - **Iverilog**
Icarus Verilog is a Verilog simulation and synthesis tool. It operates as a compiler, compiling source code written in Verilog (IEEE-1364) into some target format.

### - **GTKwave**
GTKWave is a fully featured GTK+ v1. 2 based wave viewer for Unix and Win32 which reads Ver Structural Verilog Compiler generated AET files as well as standard Verilog VCD/EVCD files and allows their viewing.


### Installing necessary softwares:
  ```
  sudo apt-get install git 
  sudo apt-get install iverilog 
  sudo apt-get install gtkwave 
  ```
### 4.2 Steps & Results:
steps for functional-simulation:-<br />
1.To clone the respository and download the netlist files for simulation, enter the following commands in your terminal<br />
``` 
 $ sudo apt install -y git
 $ git clone https://github.com/Sritam519/iiitb_bcdc.git
```
 
2.To run the simulation use the following commands:- <br />
``` 
 $ cd iiitb_bcdc
 $ iverilog iiitb_bcdc.v iiitb_bcdc_tb.v
 $ gtkwave iiitb_bcdc.vsd
 ```
 The output waveform is given below.
